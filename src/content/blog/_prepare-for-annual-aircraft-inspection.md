## Why Annual Inspections Matter

FAA regulations require that every aircraft receive an **annual inspection** to remain airworthy. But beyond compliance, annuals are an opportunity to **catch small issues before they become big problems**.

## How to Prepare for Your Annual

1. **Review Maintenance Logs**  
   Ensure ADs (Airworthiness Directives) and SBs (Service Bulletins) are current.

2. **Clean the Aircraft Thoroughly**  
   A clean airframe helps mechanics spot potential issues.

3. **Address Known Squawks**  
   If youâ€™re aware of issues, report them upfrontâ€”donâ€™t wait for the inspector to find them.

4. **Plan Ahead for Parts**  
   Ordering in advance prevents delays if replacements are needed.

## Benefits of Preparation

- **Less downtime** during inspection.
- **Lower costs** by avoiding last-minute fixes.
- **Improved safety** with proactive care.
