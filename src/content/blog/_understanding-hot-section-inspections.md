## What is a Hot Section Inspection?

A **Hot Section Inspection (HSI)** is one of the most important procedures in turboprop engine care. It involves disassembling and inspecting the ‚Äúhot‚Äù components of the engine‚Äîcompressor turbine, power turbine, combustion chamber, and associated parts.

## When Are HSIs Required?

- Typically required **midway to TBO (Time Between Overhaul)**.
- Often scheduled around **1,800‚Äì2,500 hours**, depending on the PT6 model.
- May be required sooner for engines in harsh environments.

## Why HSIs Matter

1. **Catch Damage Early**  
   Detect cracks, burns, or erosion before they cause failures.

2. **Ensure Performance**  
   A clean, healthy hot section helps the engine produce maximum power.

3. **Protect Resale Value**  
   Engines with recent HSIs are more attractive to buyers.

## What Owners Should Expect

- Detailed borescope inspections.
- Disassembly of key hot section components.
- Replacement of worn parts.
