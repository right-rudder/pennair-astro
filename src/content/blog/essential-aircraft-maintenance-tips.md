Owning an aircraft is a rewarding experience, but it also comes with significant responsibilities. Regular maintenance is key to ensuring safety, reliability, and longevity. At Penn Air Repair, we help aircraft owners at Heritage Field (KPTW) stay on top of their maintenance needs with expert guidance and services.

## Why Aircraft Maintenance Matters

Aircraft maintenance is more than just a regulatory requirement—it’s critical for ensuring safety and performance. Neglecting maintenance can lead to costly repairs, reduced efficiency, and safety risks. Regular inspections and timely repairs keep your aircraft in optimal condition and compliant with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) standards.

## Basic Maintenance Tasks Every Owner Should Know

While professional services are essential, there are some basic maintenance tasks every aircraft owner should be familiar with:

1. **Pre-Flight Inspections:** Before every flight, check for any visible issues such as fluid leaks, worn tires, or damage to the airframe.
2. **Oil Changes:** Regular oil changes keep your engine running smoothly. Follow your aircraft’s maintenance manual for recommended intervals.
3. **Cleaning and Corrosion Prevention:** Clean your aircraft regularly to remove dirt, bugs, and debris. Apply anti-corrosion treatments, especially if your aircraft operates near saltwater.
4. **Battery Care:** Ensure the battery is charged and properly connected. Check for signs of wear or corrosion on terminals.
5. **Logbook Updates:** Keep detailed records of all maintenance work. Accurate logbooks are essential for compliance and can increase resale value.
