## Why the TBM Demands Precision Maintenance

The **Daher TBM series (700/850/900/910/940)** combines jet-like speed with turboprop efficiency. But its high performance also means owners must **stay ahead on maintenance**.

## Key Maintenance Areas for TBMs

1. **PT6A-66D Engine Inspections**  
   High-performance engines demand precise care and timely hot section inspections.

2. **Avionics Updates**  
   Modern TBMs use Garmin G3000 and G1000 suitesâ€”software updates are critical.

3. **Pressurization Systems**  
   With frequent high-altitude flights, leaks or valve issues canâ€™t be ignored.

4. **Propeller Maintenance**  
   Ensure governors and blades meet manufacturer requirements.

## Tips for TBM Owners

- Track **time-limited components** carefully.
- Keep up with **Daher service bulletins**.
- Partner with shops experienced in **high-performance turboprops**.
