## Why King Airs Remain Industry Leaders

For decades, the **Beechcraft King Air series** has been the standard for twin turboprop performance. With models ranging from the C90 to the 350, these aircraft remain trusted by private operators, corporations, and government agencies worldwide.

But longevity requires **dedicated upkeep**.

## Key Maintenance Areas for King Airs

1. **PT6 Engine Care**  
   As with the PC-12, engine health is critical. Regular borescope inspections and monitoring oil analysis trends are essential.

2. **Cabin Pressurization Systems**  
   Seal degradation can cause costly issues if ignored.

3. **Landing Gear Inspections**  
   High-cycle operations demand more frequent gear overhauls.

4. **Avionics Modernization**  
   Many older King Airs benefit from ADS-B, WAAS GPS, and modern EFIS upgrades.
