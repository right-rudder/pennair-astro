      "A pitot-static inspection verifies the accuracy of your aircraft’s airspeed, altitude, and vertical speed indicators. This FAA-required certification ensures that your pitot-static system, altimeter, encoder, and transponder output accurate information to both the pilot and Air Traffic Control (ATC), which is essential for safe flight, especially under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). Certification is required every 24 months for IFR-certified aircraft.",
